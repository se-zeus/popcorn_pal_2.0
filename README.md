## üé¨‚ú® **What‚Äôs New in Version 2.0?** ‚ú®üé•  

The system has evolved significantly, integrating advanced features and modernizing the user experience:

### üîÑ **Evolution Snapshot: Old vs. New**
1. **Static to Dynamic Data**:
   - **Before**: Movie details were static with limited options.  
   - **Now**: Real-time updates via **dynamic web scraping**, fetching movie titles, cast details, genres, and visually appealing posters. Stay updated with the **latest releases**, creating a personalized and dynamic cinema experience.

2. **Enhanced Recommendations**:
   - **Before**: Recommendations were based only on cosine similarity.  
   - **Now**: A blend of **cosine similarity** and **sentiment analysis** ensures the suggestions resonate not just with your taste but also align with audience sentiments. This elevates the system from generic recommendations to **emotionally enriched suggestions**.

3. **Trending Movies Feature**:
   - Discover **trending movies** with a single click. A dedicated section now highlights popular and critically acclaimed films.

4. **User Following Feature**:
   - Follow users to explore their favorite movies and watchlists. Create a shared cinematic journey with friends and like-minded movie enthusiasts.

5. **UI Transformation**:
   - The interface has been revamped to resemble a **classic cinema website**, incorporating immersive designs and interactive elements.  
   - **New Features**:
     - Interactive posters with trailer playback.
     - Smooth navigation for exploring cast details, biographies, and movie reviews.

## üìö **How to Run the Project?**

### Setting Up Multiple Python Environments (3.6 and 3.10)
Some dependencies may not be compatible with Python 3.6. It is recommended to create separate environments to ensure smooth functionality.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/se-zeus/popcorn_pal_2.0.git
   cd popcorn_pal_2.0
   ```

2. **Set Up Python 3.6 Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name movie_env_36 python=3.6
   conda activate movie_env_36
   pip install -r requirements_36.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Python 3.10 Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name movie_env_310 python=3.10
   conda activate movie_env_310
   pip install -r requirements_310.txt
   ```

4. **Modify TMDB API Key**:
   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `static/recommend.js` (lines 15 and 29) with your TMDB API key.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Activate the desired environment:
     ```bash
     conda activate movie_env_310  # Or movie_env_36
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.

## üîç **Technical Details**

### **Cosine Similarity**:
Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between movie metadata. It computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors, representing the text features of movies.

### **Sentiment Analysis**:
Analyzes user reviews to gauge positive or negative sentiments, enriching recommendations with audience feedback.
